"""Stage1 code generator: model to internal API.

At stage1, each generated Fortran function is a standalone piece, which requires
as function arguments the values for all symbols that the expression refers to
(even if there is another stage1 function that could be used to compute that
quantity). This format is convenient to generate in SymPy. Dependencies are
analyzed later, in stage2.

The RHSs of quantities may depend also on derivatives of other quantities defined
in the model; definitions for any needed derivatives are automatically generated,
by symbolically differentiating the definition of the original quantity
referred to (and then algebraically simplifying the result). Any derivatives
that the definitions show to be identically zero are automatically dropped.

This derivative processing is performed recursively to catch any new derivatives
that may appear on the RHS in the differentiation. Circular lookups are treated
as an error; if this happens, check the definitions.

SymPy applied functions (unspecified function with known dependencies) are
allowed on the RHSs, since they can be formally differentiated.

For the definition format, see modelbase.py.

Finally, note that it is not necessary to define everything in stage1;
if you have a custom Fortran code to compute some functions (and/or their
derivatives), just tell stage2 about its interface, and those functions will
be considered as stage1 code (on equal footing with any code generated here).
